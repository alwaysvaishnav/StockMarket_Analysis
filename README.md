This project focuses on analyzing historical stock data for BankNifty and Nifty indices over a one-year period. The primary objective is to calculate the trading range for each trading day, defined as the difference between the highest and lowest prices observed during that day.

The analysis is conducted using Jupyter, which provides a user-friendly environment for processing and organizing large datasets. The dataset used in this project comprises the daily closing prices for BankNifty and Nifty indices, covering a span of one year.

The data analysis workflow involves the following steps:

Data Import: The historical stock data for BankNifty and Nifty indices are imported into Excel for analysis. This data typically includes information such as date, open price, high price, low price, closing price, and volume.

Calculation of Daily Trading Range: The daily trading range is determined by subtracting the lowest price observed during a trading day from the highest price observed on the same day. This calculation is performed for each trading day in the dataset.

The results of this analysis, including the daily trading ranges for BankNifty and Nifty indices, can be found in the Excel file attached in the GitHub repository. The Excel file provides a detailed record of the calculated ranges for each trading day, allowing for further examination and interpretation.
